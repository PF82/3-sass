1-Store Data with Sass Variables

In JavaScript, variables are defined using the let and const keywords. In Sass, variables start with a $ followed by the variable name.

$main-fonts: Arial, sans-serif;
$headings-color: green;

And to use the variables:

h1 {
  font-family: $main-fonts;
  color: $headings-color;
}

Create a variable $text-color and set it to red. Then change the value of the color property for the .blog-post and h2 to the $text-color variable.

Solution:
<style type='text/scss'>
    $text-color: red;
  
      .header{
        text-align: center;
      }
      .blog-post, h2 {
        color: $text-color;
      }
    </style>
-->

<!-- 
2-Nest CSS with Sass

nav {
  background-color: red;
}

nav ul {
  list-style: none;
}

nav ul li {
  display: inline-block;
}

For a large project, the CSS file will have many lines and rules. This is where nesting can help organize your code by placing child style rules 
within the respective parent elements:

nav {
  background-color: red;

  ul {
    list-style: none;

    li {
      display: inline-block;
    }
  }
}

Use the nesting technique shown above to re-organize the CSS rules for both children of .blog-post element. For testing purposes, the h1 should 
come before the p element.

Solution:
<style type='text/scss'>
    .blog-post {
      h1 {
        text-align: center;
        color: blue;
      }
      p {
        font-size: 20px;
      }
    }
    </style>
-->

<!-- 
3-Create Reusable CSS with Mixins

Newer CSS features take time before they are fully adopted and ready to use in all browsers. As features are added to browsers, CSS rules 
using them may need vendor prefixes. Consider box-shadow:

div {
  -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #fff;
  -moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #fff;
  -ms-box-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #fff;
  box-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #fff;
}

It's a lot of typing to re-write this rule for all the elements that have a box-shadow, or to change each value to test different effects. 
Mixins are like functions for CSS. Here is how to write one:

@mixin box-shadow($x, $y, $blur, $c){ 
  -webkit-box-shadow: $x $y $blur $c;
  -moz-box-shadow: $x $y $blur $c;
  -ms-box-shadow: $x $y $blur $c;
  box-shadow: $x $y $blur $c;
}

The definition starts with @mixin followed by a custom name. The parameters (the $x, $y, $blur, and $c in the example above) are optional. Now 
any time a box-shadow rule is needed, only a single line calling the mixin replaces having to type all the vendor prefixes. A mixin is called 
with the @include directive:

div {
  @include box-shadow(0px, 0px, 4px, #fff);
}

Write a mixin for border-radius and give it a $radius parameter. It should use all the vendor prefixes from the example. Then use the 
border-radius mixin to give the #awesome element a border radius of 15px.

Solution:
<style type='text/scss'>
    @mixin border-radius($radius){
    -webkit-border-radius:$radius;
    -moz-border-radius:$radius;
    -ms-border-radius:$radius;
    border-radius:$radius;;
  }
  
  
      #awesome {
        width: 150px;
        height: 150px;
        background-color: green;
        @include border-radius(15px);
      }
    </style>
-->

<!-- 
4-Use @if and @else to Add Logic To Your Styles

@mixin text-effect($val) {
  @if $val == danger {
    color: red;
  }
  @else if $val == alert {
    color: yellow;
  }
  @else if $val == success {
    color: green;
  }
  @else {
    color: black;
  }
}

Create a mixin called border-stroke that takes a parameter $val. The mixin should check for the following conditions using @if, @else if, and @else:

light - 1px solid black
medium - 3px solid black
heavy - 6px solid black

If $val is not light, medium, or heavy, the border should be set to none.   

Solution:
<style type='text/scss'>
    @mixin border-stroke($val) {
    @if $val == light {
      border: 1px solid black;
    }
    @else if $val == medium {
      border: 3px solid black;
    }
    @else if $val == heavy {
      border: 6px solid black;
    }
    @else {
      border: none;
    }
  }
  
      #box {
        width: 150px;
        height: 150px;
        background-color: red;
        @include border-stroke(medium);
      }
    </style>
-->

<!-- 
5-Use @for to Create a Sass Loop

@for $i from 1 through 12 {
  .col-#{$i} { width: 100%/12 * $i; }
}

The #{$i} part is the syntax to combine a variable (i) with text to make a string. When the Sass file is converted to CSS, it looks like this:

.col-1 {
  width: 8.33333%;
}

.col-2 {
  width: 16.66667%;
}

...

.col-12 {
  width: 100%;
}

This is a powerful way to create a grid layout. Now you have twelve options for column widths available as CSS classes.

Write a @for directive that takes a variable $j that goes from 1 to 6.

It should create 5 classes called .text-1 to .text-5 where each has a font-size set to 15px multiplied by the index.

Solution:
<style type='text/scss'>
    @for $j from 1 through 6 {
      .text-#{$j} { font-size: 15px * $j; }
    }
    </style>
-->

<!-- 
6-Use @each to Map Over Items in a List

$colors: (color1: blue, color2: red, color3: green);

@each $key, $color in $colors {
  .#{$color}-text {color: $color;}
}

Note that the $key variable is needed to reference the keys in the map. Otherwise, the compiled CSS would have color1, color2... in it. Both of 
the above code examples are converted into the following CSS:

.blue-text {
  color: blue;
}

.red-text {
  color: red;
}

.green-text {
  color: green;
}

Write an @each directive that goes through a list: blue, black, red and assigns each variable to a .color-bg class, where the color part changes 
for each item. Each class should set the background-color the respective color.   

Solution:
<style type='text/scss'>
    $background-colors: (background-color1: blue, background-color2: black, background-color3: red);
  
  @each $key, $background-color in $background-colors {
    .#{$background-color}-bg {background-color: $background-color;}
  }
  
      div {
        height: 200px;
        width: 200px;
      }
    </style>
-->

<!-- 
7-Apply a Style Until a Condition is Met with @while

$x: 1;
@while $x < 13 {
  .col-#{$x} { width: 100%/12 * $x;}
  $x: $x + 1;
}

First, define a variable $x and set it to 1. Next, use the @while directive to create the grid system while $x is less than 13. After setting 
the CSS rule for width, $x is incremented by 1 to avoid an infinite loop.

Use @while to create a series of classes with different font-sizes.

There should be 5 different classes from text-1 to text-5. Then set font-size to 15px multiplied by the current index number. Make sure to 
avoid an infinite loop!   

Solution:
<style type='text/scss'>
    $x: 1;
    @while $x < 6 {
      .text-#{$x} { font-size: 15px * $x;}
      $x: $x + 1;
    }
    </style>
-->

<!-- 
8-Split Your Styles into Smaller Chunks with Partials

For example, if all your mixins are saved in a partial named "_mixins.scss", and they are needed in the "main.scss" file, this is how to use them 
in the main file:

@import 'mixins'

Write an @import statement to import a partial named _variables.scss into the main.scss file.

Solution:
@import 'variables'
-->

<!-- 
9-Extend One Set of CSS Styles to Another Element

For example, the below block of CSS rules style a .panel class. It has a background-color, height and border.

.panel{
  background-color: red;
  height: 70px;
  border: 2px solid green;
}

Now you want another panel called .big-panel. It has the same base properties as .panel, but also needs a width and font-size. It's possible to 
copy and paste the initial CSS rules from .panel, but the code becomes repetitive as you add more types of panels. The extend directive is a simple 
way to reuse the rules written for one element, then add more for another:

.big-panel{
  @extend .panel;
  width: 150px;
  font-size: 2em;
}

The .big-panel will have the same properties as .panel in addition to the new styles.

Make a class .info-important that extends .info and also has a background-color set to magenta.

Solution:
<style type='text/scss'>
    h3{
      text-align: center;
    }
    .info{
      width: 200px;
      border: 1px solid black;
      margin: 0 auto;
    }
    .info-important{
      @extend .info;
      background-color: magenta;
    }
  </style>
